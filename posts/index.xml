      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently listened to the audiobook the seven habits of highly effective people on storytel and in my opinion, the lessons that the book teaches are invaluable, what I took away from the book the most is that we are responsible for our lives and despite our pre-dispositions we can fight back and try to become better people, and that&amp;rsquo;s I goal that I&amp;rsquo;ve set for myself just be a better person every day.</description>
